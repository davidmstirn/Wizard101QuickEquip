# Wizard101QuickEquip
A web app for comparing equipment for the popular MMORPG Wizard101

## Usage
Right now the project is not hosted out on the web for everyone to use.

To use this web app locally...

```
git clone https://github.com/davidmstirn/Wizard101QuickEquip.git
cd Wizard101QuickEquip
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Roadmap
My goal is to mirror the way the Wizard101 backpack works for equipment as closely as possibly, with two major additions:
* The abiility to equip any item and jewel
* The ability to search for these items given the categories and items present on Wizard101Central.com

For a more granular breakdown, see the [design documentation](DESIGN.md)
